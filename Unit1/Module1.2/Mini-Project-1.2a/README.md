### Mini Project Instructions

1. Open the [project page on OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5295881-create-web-page-layouts-with-css/5341491-set-media-queries-for-different-devices#/id/r-5548117)

1. After getting your HTML page working on your computer you should have two files `index.html` and `style.css`.

1. Using the process you learned in Unit 0, upload both these files to the `/Unit1/Module1.2/Mini-Project1.2a` directory of your personal GitHub repository.

1. As usual, create a new branch and then new Pull Request and assign it to your coach for review.
