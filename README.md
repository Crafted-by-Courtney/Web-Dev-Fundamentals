# Web Dev Fundamentals Overview

This curriculum is based on the [Open Classrooms Web Developer Path](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/141-web-developer) with added supplementary lessons, exercises, and projects. It is designed to lay the foundation for a career in software development. After you complete Units 0 through 4 here you can either branch off into different more specialized tracks (e.g. full-stack, frontend, or backend) or proceed to advanced web developer courses from OpenClassrooms.

# Getting Started

There are multiple Modules within each Unit (e.g. "Module 1.1"). A Module is made up of a particular OpenClassrooms course plus a set self-graded quizzes and assignments, graded mini-projects, and a unit project. Most of the curriculum and assignments are part of an Open Classrooms (OC) course but in some cases we have added material or projects that are not part of an OC course. 

As you go through each Module you will find self-graded quizzes and assignments (each of which are listed under each Module's Self-Graded Assignments section). Mini-Projects and Unit Projects must be submitted to a Shift_Up coach for grading and feedback via GitHub (you will learn this process in Unit 0). There will be a folder in your personal GitHub repository where you place the files for each assignment. At the end of each Unit you will do a Unit Project which will be reviewed in-depth by a coach. You can only get approval for finishing a Unit after a coach approves your Unit Project.
