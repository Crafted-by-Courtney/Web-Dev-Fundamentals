### Welcome to the Unit 3 Project!

This project will build on the book-tracking app you created at the end of Module 3.2 (the Open Classrooms Javascript course). After you get the code working as the OC quiz instructions describe, you will get to add some of your own custom functionality the book app.

### Project Instructions

1. Open the [project page on Open Classrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5664271-learn-programming-with-javascript/exercises/3800)

1. Complete the project according to the instructions at OC link above but make sure you Unzip the project code inside `EN_starter NEW.zip` and save it to the `PROJECT_SUBMISSION` directory within your local Git repo (`your-name/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/Unit1/Unit3-Project`).  

1. After you complete the project and find out secret word (and answer the question on the quiz correctly), you will add some additional code to `Book.js`.

1. TODO: create additional challenge

1. Once you are happy with your code, create a new branch (e.g. `unit-project3`), push all your local changes to the branch (which will include 6 new files inside the `PROJECT_SUBMISSION` directory), then go to GitHub and create a new Pull Request and assign to your coach for review.
